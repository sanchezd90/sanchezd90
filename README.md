I'm Daniel Sánchez
I’m interested in software development. 
I’m currently learning web app development using mainly react and node.js. I'm also learning desktop app development using Python and web development using Blazor(.Net).
I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal with behavioural or cognitive assessment.
